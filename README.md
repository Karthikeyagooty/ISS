**Classical Ciphers: Caesar, Playfair, and Hill Cipher**
**Introduction**
This repository contains Python implementations of three classical encryption algorithms:

**Caesar Cipher:** A simple shift cipher that replaces each letter with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
**Playfair Cipher:** A digraph substitution cipher using a 5x5 matrix of letters for encryption.
**Hill Cipher:** A polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts blocks of letters using matrix multiplication.
These ciphers serve as fundamental building blocks in cryptography, demonstrating encryption techniques before the modern era of cryptographic algorithms.

**Features** 
Easy-to-understand implementations
Encrypt and decrypt messages using each cipher
Supports user input for customized encryption
Simple matrix-based approach for Hill Cipher
